# 🎨 Style Guide: Progress App

> **Clarity. Focus. Growth.**

This document defines the design philosophy and aesthetic standards for the **Progress App**. Our goal is to create a professional, calm, and inspiring environment that facilitates deep focus and steady personal development.

## � Core Philosophy: "The Minimalist Growth"

The design is built on the concept of **Ascent**—a steady, clear path upward. It avoids distractions, flashy neons, and "gaming" aesthetics in favor of a clean, sophisticated workspace.

- **Organic Minimalism**: Plenty of whitespace (breathing room) to reduce cognitive load.
- **Professional & Trustworthy**: A UI that feels like a high-end productivity tool, not a game.
- **Calm Momentum**: Soft transitions and a peaceful palette to keep the user focused on their goals.

## 🎨 Color Palette

We use a "Nature-Inspired Professional" palette that evokes growth, stability, and clarity.

### ⚪ Primary Surfaces
- **Alabaster White** (`#FBFBFA`): Main background for a clean, paper-like feel.
- **Soft Stone** (`#F1F1EF`): To differentiate sections or cards.
- **Mist Grey** (`#6B7280`): For secondary text and subtle borders.

### 🌳 Growth & Action
- **Forest Slate** (`#1E293B`): Our primary "ink" color for deep contrast and readability.
- **Growth Sage** (`#10B981`): A soft, organic green used for progress indicators and completion.
- **Ascent Blue** (`#3B82F6`): A professional blue for primary actions and links.

## ✍️ Typography

The typography should feel authoritative yet approachable.

- **Headings**: `Playfair Display` or `Outfit` (used with generous letter spacing). It should feel clean and intentional.
- **Body**: `Inter`. Optimized for long-term reading of journals and task lists.

### Hierarchy
- **H1 (Focus)**: `2.5rem`, Semi-bold, Forest Slate. No gradients, just solid, crisp text.
- **H2 (Section)**: `1.5rem`, Medium, Forest Slate.
- **Body**: `0.95rem`, Regular, `line-height: 1.6`, Mist Grey.

## ✨ Design Elements & Components

### 🖼️ Elevated Simplicity
Instead of glassmorphism and glows, we use:
- **Soft Depth**: Very subtle shadows (`box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`).
- **Hairline Borders**: `1px solid #E5E7EB` for clean separation.
- **Generous Padding**: Giving content room to breathe is our primary "design feature".

### 📉 Meaningful Data
Data visualization should be clinical and clean:
- **Thin Line Weights**: For charts, keeping them elegant.
- **Solid Fills**: No glowing effects; use solid, soft colors.
- **Clarity First**: Labels and axes should be clearly legible without hovering.

### 🧩 Interaction Logic
- **Subtle Transitions**: Use `ease-in-out` for hover states, but keep them minimal (e.g., a slight background color change).
- **Static Reliability**: Avoid unnecessary animations that distract from the task at hand.

## 📱 Responsiveness
- **Functional Layouts**: Ensure that on mobile, the app feels like a high-quality journal or notebook.
- **Desktop Focus**: Use wide layouts to display data side-by-side with reflections, mimicking a professional dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Accessibility
- **High Contrast**: Ensure text-to-background ratios exceed WCAG AA standards.
- **Focus States**: Clearly visible outlines for keyboard navigation to ensure the app is usable by everyone.
